I have a big pile of mp3 audiobooks.

I want to be able to play them on my phone.

This project hosts those audiobooks as podcasts, providing an rss feed for each. This way, instead of loading them up as music, which won't save your spot or keep track of what's already been played, it'll load them as podcasts, which do all of those things.

On startup, the app creates a folder, ~/AudiobookCaster.

The user then adds their audiobook (a folder containing mp3s) to that directory.

If that folder contains a jpg or png, the app will automatically use that in the rss feed for the "podcast" thumbnail.
